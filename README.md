# Microsoft-Excel-for-Beginners


## Introduction:
This is my First Excel Portfolio Project as a part of **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**. This project is to Clean and Analyze the data at beginner level to derive insights using simple Aggregating Functions and Pivot Tables.

**_Disclaimer_**: The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: **https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Government/Fleet-Equipment-Inventory/93vc-wpdr** under a Public Domain license.I am using a modified subset of that dataset, rather than the dataset from the original source.


Dataset Used : Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_2_START.xlsx



## Tasks Performed:

- Format the data as a table,
- Used Aggregated Functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT for to drive insights from COLUMN C (Equipment Count),
- Created Pivot Tables,
- Analyzed data in the pivot table.


Cleaned Dataset : Montgomery_Fleet_Equipment_Inventory_FA_PART_2_Data Analyzing.xlsx


Conclusions:
- SUM = 1582
- AVERAGE = 32.28
- MIN = 1
- MAX = 379
- COUNT = 49
